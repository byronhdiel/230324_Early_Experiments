# 230324_Early_Experiments
Noob data science experiments.
# This is my first repository and will serve as an experiment in how to handle GIT and github operations. 
# Likely the code in this repository will contain code adapted from various course in Coursera, Udemy, and DataCamp. 
# Any code that I did not truly originate, I will comment to attempt to properly credit the sources. 
# I am still learning the proper conventions for documentation, and will attempt a good faith effort to document sources appropriately.
# This repository is for experimental, educational, and personal use only and I have no intent to directly profit from its content. 
# If anyone has read this far, thank you for your interest. Byron H Diel.
